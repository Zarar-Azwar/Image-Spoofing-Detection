# Image Spoofing Detection

## 📷 Detect Real vs. Spoofed Images with AI

Image Spoofing Detection is a web application that uses deep learning to classify whether an uploaded image is **real** or **fake**. The model is trained on a dataset of real and spoofed images and leverages **CNN-based deep learning** for classification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for accurate image classification.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Upload an image and get an instant classification as **FAKE** or **REAL**.
- **Flask Web Application**: Simple and interactive UI for testing images.

## 📌 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Spoofing-Detection.git
   cd Image-Spoofing-Detection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
